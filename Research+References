Useful links used during research:

- The Lecture videos were by far the most useful as our lecturer went through all the 
  code methodically aswell as demonstrating the code in drawings before each coding session video.

- Links that were very useful in the initial stage of understanding the Shunting algorithm:

- Links that extended my knowledge of the program and helped me to implement other special characters:
